Andy Murray has admitted that there is “uncertainty about the summer” as he dreams of playing at the Olympics, but also he vowed not to “just take one of the other guys’ spots” on the Great Britain team. Murray admitted in February that he is likely to bring the curtain down on his career later this year as he “did not plan on playing much past this summer”. Murray plans to play a full season with Wimbledon likely to be his last tournament on the surface, but he also confirmed that he would love to play at the 2024 Olympics.
