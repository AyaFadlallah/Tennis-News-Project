For Shelby Coleman, her inspiration for this year's shoot theme derived from Andre Agassi’s acclaimed autobiography “Open” and the Hall of Famer's candidness with the ups and downs of life on tour. “I wanted to take a moment not to look at these people as the phenomenal athletes that they are, but instead as people. Up close and personal,” Coleman said. To achieve that, a camera was rigged to a sliding dolly to get the framing within inches of  a player’s face. All participants had warning from Josselyn and Benji Lee about just how close the camera would be approaching.
