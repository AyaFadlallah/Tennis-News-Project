Miami Day 3 previews: Taylor Townsend vs. Elise Mertens. There are more similarities than differences between these two players, making for an exciting second-round match. Theyâ€™ve spent nearly the same amount of time on tour, competing since 2012 and 2013, respectively. Both, the American and the Belgian, bring successful doubles play to the table, so it would be no surprise to see either work their way forward. While Elise Mertens has reached a singles career-high ranking of No. 12, Townsend should not be counted out in what could be a first-time meeting for the books. The Winner was Taylor Townsend.
