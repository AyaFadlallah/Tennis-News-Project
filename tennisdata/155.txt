Swiatek has been in romping mode so far in Indian Wells; she has lost just 17 games in five matches. When she has time to set up for her shots and pick her targets, Swiatek is exceptionally tough to beat, and the slow hard courts here give her time to do that. Sakkari will need to keep Swiatek on defense by making first serves, and take the offensive when Iga throws in her spinny second serve. Sakkari says she has been trying to get back to attacking more with her return of serve. She probably wonâ€™t have other choice Sunday.
