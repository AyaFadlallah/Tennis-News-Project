Defending champion Alex De Minaur battled past Stefanos Tsitsipas 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday to book a second straight spot in the semifinals of the Mexican Open. Alex De Minaur, the ATP's ninth-ranked player, struggled in the first set and lost it in 28 minutes but rallied in the next two to get the win in 2 hours, 6 minutes. "It was a tough match. It was not very spectacular because the wind made it hard for both of us," said Alex De Minaur. "My first win against Tsitsipas was meant to be in Acapulco, a place of great memories."
