Fresh off a run to her second Indian Wells title, top seed Iga Swiatek awaits either countrywoman Magdalena Frech or big-hitting Camila Giorgi in the second round. It will be the 22-year-old’s first time playing in Miami since 2022, having skipped last year’s event due to injury. She’ll have to hit the ground running as yet another clash with Linda Noskova looms in the third round: Should they both advance, it would be Swiatek and Noskova’s third meeting of the year. The Czech youngster famously knocked out Swiatek in an Australian Open, but Iga avenged her defeat in Indian Wells.
