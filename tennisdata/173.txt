Indian Wells Day 9 Previews: Jiri Lehecka vs. Jannik Sinner. Facing each other for the first time on tour, these two 22-year-olds are ready to leave it all on the court. As Sinner breaks records for Italian tennis and establishes himself comfortably in the Top 3, Jiri Lehecka is gaining confidence with his first career title earlier this year, along with victories over Andrey Rublev and Stefanos Tsitsipas in this very tournament. If anyone can take down the Italian for the first time this year, itâ€™s the confidence-carrying Czech. If, though, is the operative word. The Winner was Jannik Sinner.
