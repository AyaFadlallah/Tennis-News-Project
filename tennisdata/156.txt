Still tops in the control department, the latest racquet CX is updated to be faster, firmer, and more spin-friendly. The cross strings on the CX have been widened in the center of the string bed to give the frame enhanced spin potential and power. The hoop now has more of a box shape at the 2 and 10 o’clock positions to better the racquet’s stability and increase frame stiffness through the face and throat. The composure at contact is intended to improve shot accuracy. A new vibration-dampening material has been inserted at 3 and 9 o’clock positions on the face.
