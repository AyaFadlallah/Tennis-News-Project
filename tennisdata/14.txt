Tim Henman has described Novak Djokovic’s withdrawal from the 2024 Miami Open as “quite revealing” because the great Serb referenced balancing his “private and professional” schedule. Laura Robson also shared her thoughts on Djokovic’s decision and feels it could be due to him wanting to spend more time with his children. Following his upset defeat to Nardi at the Indian Wells Masters last week, it was announced that Djokovic would not feature in the second leg of the ‘Sunshine Double’. In a post on X, he said: “At this stage of my career, I’m balancing my private and professional schedule”.
