At 26, Taylor Fritz has enjoyed a solid start to 2024, reaching the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and winning his seventh ATP title in Delray Beach last month. Into the fourth round without dropping a set, he made quick work of No. 19 seed Sebastian Baez, dropping just four games to book the clash with Rune, who got a walkover in his first match and dug out of a second-set tiebreaker to defeat Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets on Monday. The start of their match was similarly tense as the two traded service holds through the first five games.
