Djokovicâ€™s exit gives Miami a futuristic feel on the ATP side. This may be what the draws at majors and Masters will look like in the coming years after Djokovic retires and Alcaraz and Sinner enter their primes. Alcaraz won this title two years ago, but Sinner beat him in the semis in 2023. A rematch in the final would be popular, but they face plenty of obstacles. Sinner has No. 3 seed Daniil Medvedev on his side, while Alcaraz has No. 4 Alexander Zverev. The Russian is the defending champion in Miami; the German reached the final in 2018.
