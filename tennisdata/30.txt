Ugo Humbert didn't face a break point before converting his first match point to reach the quarterfinals and secure his first career win over Andy Murray, who lifted the trophy in Dubai in 2017. In other results Wednesday, top-seeded Daniil Medvedev recovered from a set down to overcome Lorenzo Sonego 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 to reach the quarterfinals. Daniil Medvedev opened his title defense Tuesday by beating Alexander Shevchenko 6-3, 7-5 in his first match since losing the Australian Open final to Jannik Sinner. Medvedev will next face eighth-seeded Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who advanced after Jakub Mensik retired with an injury.
