Rafael Nadal is set to play in back-to-back clay-court tournaments in April after it was confirmed that he is on the entry list for the Barcelona Open. The 22-time Grand Slam winner is set to make his long-awaited return to competitive action at the Monte Carlo Masters with the tournament running from April 8-14 and he will then immediately head to Spain for the Barcelona Open. The ATP 500 event gets underway on April 15 and the Spaniard – who has slipped to No 647 in the ATP Rankings – has again used his protected ranking to get into the main draw.
