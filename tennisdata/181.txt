Naomi Osaka took positives from an otherwise disappointing loss at the 2024 BNP Paribas Open on Monday, praising her fighting spirit despite ultimately bowing out of Indian Wells, 7-5, 6-4 to Elise Mertens. “I wanted to win more slams. That's why I came back,” Osaka admitted in her post-match press conference. “But I think I determine success right now just by the effort that I put in, and I feel like today I don't think I played well at all”. “I think, like, before I was pregnant, there were matches that I didn't try as hard as I tried today”
