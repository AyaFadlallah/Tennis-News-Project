Defending champion Cameron Norrie beat Brazil's Thiago Seyboth Wild 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 on Friday to reach the semifinals of the Rio Open. The second-seeded British player will take on Argentina's Mariano Navone on Saturday. Mariano Navone overcame Brazil's 17-year-old sensation João Fonseca 2-6, 6-3, 6-3. The 23rd-ranked Cameron Norrie became the favorite to win the clay-court tournament again after Carlos Alcaraz retired with a right ankle injury and Stan Wawrinka and Nicolás Jarry were defeated. Cameron Norrie said he was excited playing against the crowd who saw him win the tournament last year in a hard-fought final against Carlos Alcaraz.
