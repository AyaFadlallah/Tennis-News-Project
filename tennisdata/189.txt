
Racquet Review: Babolat Pure Strike 98 (16x19). The flagship model in the Pure Strike family gets updated with a more forgiving feel and improved control. For this fourth generation of the Pure Strike, Babolat addressed the frame’s command and feel at contact. The racquet’s beam has been softened by 2-to-3 RA rating points to dial back some of the power so there’s greater control and comfort. NF2 Tech filters out unwanted vibration. This improves the feel of the frame and produces a more muted sound at contact, which Babolat Pure Strike believes gives the user a better perception of control.
