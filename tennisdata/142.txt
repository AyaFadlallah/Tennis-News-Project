An hour short of noon, on the middle Sunday of this year’s BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., the tournament’s chief marketing officer, Philippe Dore, was in an expansive mood. Who could blame him? So much of the present was in tip-top shape. Everything from perfect weather conditions–dry and in the low 70s–to the deep player fields and the filled stadiums and field courts made this first leg of tennis’ “Sunshine Swing” persistently alluring. Indian Wells and Miami are spring break for tennis aficionados. Throughout Saturday and Sunday in Indian Wells, 108,000 fans poured through the gates.
