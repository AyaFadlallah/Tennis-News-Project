Martina Navratilova feels Andy Murray is “doing the right thing” by not telling the press exactly when he will retire, saying it becomes exhausting when every tournament is turned into “a massive goodbye”. On the back of constant questions over his future, Murray snapped in February as he confirmed he is “likely not gonna play past the summer” adding that he is “bored” of the rumors surrounding his retirement. “You know, I get asked about it after every single match that I play, every single tournament that I play, and I’m bored of the question to be honest,” he said.
