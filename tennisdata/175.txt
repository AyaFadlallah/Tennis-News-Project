Marta Kostyuk experienced an emotional release 10 days ago in San Diego, triggered by a three-set defeat in the final to Katie Boulter. The 21-year-old delivered a stirring runner-up speech, dedicating the result to those affected by the ongoing invasion of her home country. “It was just an emotional week in general,” Kostyuk clarified at the BNP Paribas Open. And indeed, the Ukrainian was in tears earlier that week in the quarterfinal against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Playing the Russian for a second time in two weeks at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, Kostyuk was all business navigating a high-quality opening set.
