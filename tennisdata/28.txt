Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine, Daria Saville of Australia and Katie Boulter of England advanced to the quarterfinals of the Cymbiotika San Diego Open on Wednesday. Kostyuk continues to build on the form that saw her reach her first major quarterfinal last month at the Australian Open. The sixth seed knocked off the last remaining wild card by beating 18-year-old Taylah Preston of Australia, 6-4, 6-3. For Kostyuk, 21, it was like facing a mirror image of herself. "I was playing her for the very first time. She's still very young. She reminds me a little bit of me," said Kostyuk.
