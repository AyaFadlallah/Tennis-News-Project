Tim Henman has hailed Carlos Alcaraz for chasing a record held by Rafael Nadal after winning his fifth Masters 1000 title with his victory at the 2024 Indian Wells Open.  The former world No 4 also stressed the importance of Alcaraz staying injury-free, while Laura Robson suggested the Spaniard is more at risk of physical issues because of the way he moves on court. Alcaraz will not match Nadalâ€™s incredible record of winning nine crowns at this level before 21, but he can take his tally to seven if he wins upcoming Masters 1000 events in Miami and Monte Carlo.
