Iga Swiatek has opened another massive lead at the top of the WTA Rankings on the back of her Indian Wells Open success. She is already virtually assured of being the top seed at Roland Garros. Swiatek defeated Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-0 in the WTA 1000 final to notch up her 19th career title with the victory also coming with a 1,000-point boost – not that Swiatek needed a points boost as she was already clear of the chasing pack. The Pole’s advantage over second-placed Aryna Sabalenka increased to 2,520 points with Coco Gauff another 1,045 points adrift in third place.
