Carlos Alcaraz was upset by Nicolas Jarry  7-6 (2), 6-3 in the semifinals of the Argentina Open Saturday. Jarry, after the biggest win of his career, will face home crowd favorite Facundo Diaz Acosta in the final on Sunday. It will be their first tour-level meeting. Alcaraz was the defending champion but hasn't looked as sharp and aggressive this week as he was last year. Alcaraz smashed his racket onto the court after his defeat, a rare feature for the Spaniard. "Congratulations to Nico for this match and good luck for him in the final," Alcaraz said after his defeat.
