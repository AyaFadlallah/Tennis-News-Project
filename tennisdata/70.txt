At last year's French Open, Seyboth Wild upset Daniil Medvedev in the first round. "Wild is a great player. He plays well as an underdog, in Grand Slams against top players," Norrie said. "I saw him at the French Open and against Rublev this year. I know what to expect, a tough match. His top level is high." Later, João Fonseca became the first player born in 2006 to reach the quarterfinals of an ATP Tour tournament. He beat Chile’s Cristian Garin 6-4, 6-4, and will take on Mariano Navone, who came from qualifying, for a place in the semifinals.
