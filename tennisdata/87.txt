Nothing could stand in the way of Taylor Fritz successfully defending his title at Delray Beach day rain delay, which pushed the final to Monday. After a strong week at the Florida tournament, Fritz faced Tommy Paul, who had won the title in Dallas last week, in the final. Despite intense winds, and a surging opponent in Paul, Fritz left little to chance throughout the match. He took control early and held off Paul's continued attempts at a comeback to clinch the victory 6-2, 6-3. Fritz has now won his past six final-round matches and owns seven ATP titles overall.
