A low-ranked American tennis player who competed for the University of North Carolina has been suspended for two years after testing positive for marijuana during an ATP Challenger tournament. The ITIA said Casey Kania's in-competition urine test contained cannabis in August 2023 at Cary, North Carolina, where he lost in the doubles quarterfinals. Casey Kania is a 21-year-old with a career-high doubles ranking of 1,317th and $482 in career tennis earnings, according to the ATP website. The tour's site shows that all of his ranking points and all of that prize money were earned during the lower-tier tournament in Cary.
