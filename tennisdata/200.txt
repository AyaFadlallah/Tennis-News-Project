Indian Wells Day 8 Previews: Taylor Fritz vs. Holger Rune. Sitting outside the Top 10 is former Indian Wells champion Fritz. Rune is sitting at No. 7, keeping his head focused and grinding away at the opportunities. He has yet to defeat the top-ranked American, but thereâ€™s an opening to get his first victory here. Fritz has plateaued over the last few years and is struggling to take his game to the next level. His confidence must be shaken as the self-imposed pressure builds, and that is enough wiggle room for Rune to slide through into the quarterfinals. Winner: Rune.
