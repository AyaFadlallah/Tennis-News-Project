The Double is rare: only 11 players have done it on both tours. One of them, is Swiatek. Two years ago, she tore through Indian Wells and then turned around and did the same thing in Miami. She didn’t drop a set and beat Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka in lopsided fashion along the way. Swiatek has a good chance to do it again. She’s close to her 2022 level right now; once she gets a sliver of a lead, she’s running away with her matches and dropping second-set bagels. She could face the woman who beat her Linda Noskova.
