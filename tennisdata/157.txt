Smooth handling, reliable control and a plush feel have always been the calling cards of the CX 200 racquet. The racquet generally suits players with well-rounded games who don’t want a lot of help from their racquets. Just a dependable frame that does what’s asked without getting in the way. This latest edition isn’t a reinvention of that formula, but after some modifications to the layup, it does bring a slightly different playability to the court. For one thing, frame stiffness is higher than its predecessor. It has a clean, connected and comfortable response that’s crisper than the outgoing model.
