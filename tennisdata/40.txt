 Katie Boulter and Daria Saville scored decisive wins in the rain-interrupted opening round of the Cymbiotika San Diego Open. Boulter earned her first win over Lesia Tsurenko in four career matchups, 6-3, 6-1, in approximately one hour. "I know how tough she can be to play against," said Boulter. "I've never won against her before. I knew today was going to be an absolute battle. I just came out and tried to compete and do the best I could. I don't think either of us played our best tennis, but sometimes it's about finding a way, and I did that."
