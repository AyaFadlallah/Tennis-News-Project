French tennis star Arthur Cazaux gave the tennis community a big scare on Monday when he collapsed during his Miami Open qualifier. Cazaux took on his compatriot Harold Mayot in the first round of qualifying for the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in hot conditions with temperatures record above 30 degrees Celsius. Mayot won the opening set before Cazaux won the second set to take the encounter to a decider, but things took a turn for the worst for the latter with the score 2-1 in his favour. With Mayot preparing to serve with the score 30-30, Cazauxâ€™s legs gave way.
