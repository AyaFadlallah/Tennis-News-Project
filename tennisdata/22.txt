Simona Halep was beaten on her return from a doping ban, going down in three sets to Paula Badosa at the Miami Open, with former world No 1 Caroline Wozniacki choosing her moment to offer up some brutally honest views on the Romanianâ€™s comeback. Simona  Halep, a two-time Grand Slam winner who spent 64 weeks as world number one, was playing her first match since the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced her suspension from four years to nine months. Halep raced away with the first set in just 38 minutes, but Badosa dug in to win 1-6, 6-4, 6-3.
