The WTA women's tennis tour has been in negotiations to partner with Saudi Arabia, including possibly placing its season-ending WTA Finals there. "As part of our plans to grow the value of women's tennis, we regularly speak to both existing and potential commercial partners about possible new forms of collaboration. While we don't rule anything out for the future, there is no new update at this time," a WTA spokesperson wrote in an email Wednesday. Chris Evert is among those who have urged the WTA to stay out of Saudi Arabia, while pioneer Billie Jean King has advocated for engagement.
