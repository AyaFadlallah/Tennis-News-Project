The Brazilian currently ranked No. 655, is expected to jump about 200 positions after beating Fils. Fonseca said he is yet to decide whether he will play tennis for an American university later this year. "For now I am very focused on the pro-tour, I want to get to the top," said Fonseca. "That is going to be a personal decision with my family, I won't make it public now." His opponent in the 16th round will be Chileâ€™s Cristian Garin. Fonseca's victory brought some new energy for local fans, who saw three of the title favorites crash out Tuesday.
