Joao Fonseca became the first player born in 2006 to win an ATP tour-level match when the 17-year-old Brazilian beat seventh-seeded Arthur Fils, the 19-year-old French player, 6-0, 6-4 at the Rio Open on Wednesday. Joao Fonseca defeated the No. 36-ranked Frenchman Fils in front of raucous fans at the clay court tournament in Rio de Janeiro. He knelt on the court in tears to celebrate. "This is where I belong. I want to be in these huge stadiums," said Fonseca, who won the US Open boys singles title last year. "Now it is all about focusing on the process."
