Fans of Rafael Nadal will have to keep waiting for the return of the champion as he announced he would not be able to play in this week's tournament in Doha. He had previously expressed his goal of participating in the event after withdrawing from the Australian Open last month. "Unfortunately I am not ready to compete," Nadal wrote. He missed most of the 2023 season due to a hip injury. He returned to Brisbane last month, where he reached the quarterfinals, but then was unable to play at the Australian Open due to a micro tear on a muscle.
