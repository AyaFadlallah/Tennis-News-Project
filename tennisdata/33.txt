
 Donna Vekic and Dayana Yastremska were among those moving into the second-round of the Cymbiotika San Diego Open on Tuesday. Vekic, a finalist here in 2022, beat local wildcard Katherine Hui, 7-5, 6-2, in her WTA Tour singles debut. A Santa Fe Christian School graduate now playing on the collegiate level at Stanford, Hui is the reigning US Open girls' singles titlist. A first-time major semifinalist last month at the Australian Open, Yastremska had to dig deep to outlast  Caroline Dolehide, 6-4, 5-7, 6-1. She was up a set and a break only to have her opponent force a decider.
