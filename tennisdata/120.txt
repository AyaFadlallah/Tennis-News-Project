Naomi Osaka said she is swinging “free” and getting back that winning feeling after she charged past world No. 51 Elisabetta Cocciaretto on Wednesday night in Miami. The four-time Grand Slam champion hit six aces and didn’t face a single break point en route to 6-3, 6-4 victory in just 78 minutes, booking a place in the second round. “Honestly, this is probably the most free that I was able to hit my balls, like, the closest to the feeling I want to capture going forward,” Osaka said in her post-match press conference. “Yeah, I'm pretty happy with this one.”
