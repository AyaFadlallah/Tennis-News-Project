Indian Wells Day 6 Previews: Alexander Zverev vs. Alex de Minaur. The Australian has been a talking point of the 2024 season for good reason, from breaking into the Top 10 to sharing a championship weekend with girlfriend Katie Boulter. Since entering his spotlight era, de Minaur has had no problems at Indian Wells, winning sets 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 and 7-5. Making it to the quarterfinals likely won’t be as straightforward, since he’s lost to Zverev six times in eight meetings. Speaking of Zverev, ever since his return from the injury, his game has flown under the radar. Winner: Zverev.
