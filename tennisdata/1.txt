Andy Roddick had an amusing take on Iga Swiatekâ€™s current dominance as he declared that she has started to enter the era of legends like Maria Sharapova. Aged just 22, Swiatek is a four-time Grand Slam winner having won three titles at Roland Garros and one US Open trophy while she has also spent 95 weeks in total at No 1 in the WTA Rankings, which puts her in 10th place for most weeks at the top. Next is the Miami Open and the last time Swiatek won the Indian Wells trophy she went on to complete the Sunshine Double.
