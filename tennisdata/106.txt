Former world No. 1 Simona Halep is suing the Canadian company that produced a nutritional supplement that she believes led to her being handed a four-year ban for doping that could end her career. Halep is seeking more than $10 million in damages from Quantum Nutrition, which operates as Schinoussa Superfoods, after testing positive at the 2022 U.S. Open for Roxadustat, a drug often used by people with anemia. Roxadustat is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substances list because it can increase hemoglobin and the production of red blood cells, building endurance. Halep said she used Schinoussa supplements once.
