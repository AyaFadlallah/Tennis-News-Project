Kasatkina isn't only a tennis player -- although she is really good at her day job -- and, even with some shoutouts to her sponsors, her account isn't just promotional content. Kasatkina, 26, is Russian and shares publicly that she is gay, in a time where few others from her country feel able to do so. While the Russian Supreme Court recently deemed the "international LGBT movement" an "extremist organization," Kasatkina and Zabiiako document their life together traveling the world on the WTA Tour, being unapologetically in love. Their channel has more than 41,000 subscribers, 134 videos, and 100,000 views.
