On the tennis court, Daria Kasatkina has always been fearless. As a 17-year-old, she rallied back after dropping the first set to win the 2014 French Open juniors title and became the first Russian girl to do so since 1998. She was quick to find success as a professional, recording her first win over a top-10 opponent as an 18-year-old against Venus Williams in Auckland, New Zealand in 2016, and reaching the top 25 before the end of the season. Daria Kasatkina quickly became known for her crafty and versatile style of play, and even drew comparisons to Roger Federer.
