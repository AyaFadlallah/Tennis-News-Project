
Emma Raducanu is not expected to be out of action for long after pulling out of the Miami Open hours shortly before she was due to play her opening match. It has been confirmed that the back injury that prompted Emma Raducanu’s withdrawal from the Miami Open is “nothing serious”, according to her representatives. The 21-year-old, who was given a wild card for the prestigious WTA tournament, was set to play China’s Wang Xiyu in the first round on Tuesday. However, pain in her lower back caused Raducanu to pull out, with the Kent star unwilling to take any risks.
