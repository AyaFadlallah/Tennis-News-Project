Indian Wells Day 8 Previews: Casper Ruud vs. Gael Monfils. No matter the score, there’s always a sense of appreciation from these two players for being able to play on the biggest stages. Ruud’s heavy baseline game will put Monfils’ creativity to the test. Perhaps the Norwegian will get creative himself to throw off Monfils, whose tournament is already an unqualified success. Perhaps the Frenchman has a different strategy up his sleeve altogether. One thing for certain, though the crowd, both in person and watching from afar, will have a hard time rooting for just one player. Winner: Casper Ruud.
