Indian Wells Day 6 Previews: Ben Shelton vs. Jannik Sinner. Shelton is looking to end Sinner’s 17-match win streak, and the American may have as good a chance as anyone—which still might not be lots, considering the Italian's imperious form. That said, Shelton owns a win over Sinner, and it happened a few months ago. That also took place in the fourth round of a hard-court Masters event. They met again, in Vienna, and Shelton couldn’t break Sinner’s serve. Both players will fight through to the last point, and the rubber match is worthy its nighttime billing. Winner: Sinner.
