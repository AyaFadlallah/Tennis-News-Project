Holger Rune pulled off a Houdini comeback at the 2024 BNP Paribas Open, rallying from match point down to shock 2022 champion Taylor Fritz, 2-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3. "It means a lot to win these kind of matches," Rune said in his post-match press conference. "It gives me opportunity to play another match tomorrow against a great opponent." Seeded No. 7 in the desert, Rune played his best tennis on the brink of defeat against the No. 12 seed, completing the men's last-eight line-up and reaching his first Sunshine Swing quarterfinal in one hour 56 minutes on Stadium 1 Court.
