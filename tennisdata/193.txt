Simona Halep will return to playing tennis at the Miami Open this month after winning her appeal of a doping suspension and having the penalty reduced from four years to nine months. "Thank you to the tournament for giving me this opportunity and I cannot wait to be back on court and competing," the two-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1 player posted Thursday on social media. "See you all soon!". Simona Halep was given a wild-card invitation for the main draw at the hard-court tournament on the site of the Miami Dolphins stadium. Women's play begins March 19.
