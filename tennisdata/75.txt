 Coco Gauff rallied from a slow start and a second-set argument with the chair umpire to beat Karolina Pliskova 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 and reach the quarterfinals of the Dubai Championships. Gauff ended Pliskova's 11-match winning streak. The 19-year-old built a 4-2 lead in the second set before a lengthy back-and-forth with chair umpire Pierre Bacchi. Gauff complained to Bacchi that he called her serve at deuce out only after Pliskova returned it into the net. Gauff had to repeat her first serve and went on to hold for a 5-2 lead. The US Open champion said the argument "fueled" her.
