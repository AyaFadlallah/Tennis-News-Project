Miami Open Conditions: This tournament is played on a Laykold Cushion Plus hard court, which is considered a Category 2 when it comes to ITF Court Pace Rating. That means that this tournament plays slow to medium in speed. But the conditions here are a little different than they were in Indian Wells. While this event also plays slower than your average hard court, the ball doesnâ€™t bounce as high as it does in the desert. However, when humidity is high, the ball can move slower through the air. These conditions can be uncomfortable when the temperature approaches the mid-80s.
