Former top-ranked tennis player Simona Halep will go to sports' highest court to challenge her four-year ban in a doping case. The Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Tuesday that Halep plans to attend in person when the appeal opens for a closed-doors hearing scheduled over three days. The court said in a statement, "No indication can be given as to when the final arbitral award will be notified to the parties." Halep aims to overturn the ban imposed by the International Tennis Integrity Agency last September. It runs into October 2026 when the Romanian star will be 35.
