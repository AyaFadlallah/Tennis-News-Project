Rafael Nadal, who has won four Mexican Open singles finals, expressed his dismay at the scenes coming from Acapulco through an Instagram post. "I am saddened by the images of destruction from Hurricane Otis in the place where I played so many times," Nadal wrote. With its sun-soaked beaches and year-long warm temperatures, Acapulco was a premier destination during most of the 20th century. John F. Kennedy honeymooned there. Frank Sinatra referenced the area while crooning "Come Fly With Me." Elvis Presley's 1963 film "Fun in Acapulco," though filmed in Hollywood, remains a testament to America's fixation with the city.
