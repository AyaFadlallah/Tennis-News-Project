Indian Wells Day 9 Previews: Iga Swiatek vs. Caroline Wozniacki. Swiatek faced Linda Noskova earlier in the draw, and Caroline Wozniacki took on friend Angelique Kerber to earn her spot. Now, the stage is set for a battle of extreme-grip groundstrokes. Wozniacki’s backhand handles pace well due to her left hand’s position, which means she’s controlling the baseline with, essentially, two forehands. When Swiatek uses her forehand looks to dictate points and move the Dane around, she'll need to be more patient than usual, as it will take one or two more extra shots to create an opening. Winner: Swiatek.
