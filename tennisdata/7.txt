Tennis icon Martina Navratilova has rejected suggestions Emma Raducanu winning the 2021 US Open was a “fluke” as she declared the Brit “has got that level.” The 18-time Grand Slam singles champion believes, though, that Raducanu’s major victory has “become a handicap” because the expectations placed on her “have gone sky-high.” Raducanu shocked the tennis world by becoming the first player in history to win a Grand Slam title as a qualifier when she triumphed at Flushing Meadows in 2021. She did not drop a set in her 10 matches across qualifying and the main draw during a staggering run.
