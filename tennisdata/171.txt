Indian Wells Day 9 Previews: Alexander Zverev vs. Carlos Alcaraz. Heading into their ninth battle, they are quite familiar with each other’s games, with Zverev leading 5-3. Their most recent battle was in the Australian Open quarterfinals earlier this year, where Zverev defeated Alcaraz in four sets. Zverev’s pressing baseline game challenges Alcaraz’s varietal play, making for a competitive clash each time they step out to the court. Playing the defending champion is not easy, especially when the slower court plays to Alcaraz's favor, but coming in with confidence should help the German. Enough to beat Alcaraz again? Winner: Alcaraz.
