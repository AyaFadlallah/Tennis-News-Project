Daniil Medvedev says fatherhood has brought out a whole new side of him, as he now searches for the balance between dad mode and “full tennis mode.” “It’s a balance. Sometimes my wife sacrifices some of her time and energy to come to the tournaments with our daughter. Me, I have to practice less somewhere, or maybe during the tournament I just have to find the time,” said the No. 3. “Before I would be in full tennis mode. Now, I have to find the balance to see my daughter also, otherwise, it’s not a good life, I would say!”
