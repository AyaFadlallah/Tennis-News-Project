On Tuesday, March 1, the second half of the Sunshine Double kicks off with WTA action at the Miami Open. This tournament is played at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. Last year, Petra Kvitova earned a straight-set win over Elena Rybakina in the final of this event, but the Czech star won’t be out there this year. That means that Iga Swiatek is the most recent Miami Open champion in the field, as she won the tournament and completed the Sunshine Double in 2022. That’s notable considering Swiatek won the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells last week.
