On Sunday, Steve Johnson hung up his racquet at the tournament that inspired him to win four ATP singles titles and an Olympic bronze medal after earning the distinction of greatest men’s player in NCAA history. Having fallen in the qualifying of singles at Indian Wells this past Monday, Johnson walked out at the BNP Paribas Open one last time for a doubles contest with countryman Tommy Paul. The two were defeated by Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic, 6-2, 7-6 (3), on Stadium 4. “The decision to retire here was super easy. I grew up coming here as a kid”.
