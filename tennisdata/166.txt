Mirra Andreeva currently ranked No. 38, is 6-3 on the year after an up-and-down start to her sophomore season. She opened with a run to the quarterfinals in Brisbane and a trip to the Australian Open fourth round in her tournament debut, equalling her career-best Grand Slam run (2023 Wimbledon). But her momentum was halted after suffering back-to-back first-round exits in Dubai and Indian Wells. Andreeva will aim to be rested and ready as she gears up for the clay season, where her rise up the rankings began in earnest with a breakthrough run to the Madrid Open fourth round.
