Karolina Muchova, last year's runner-up at the French Open, had an operation on her right wrist for an injury that has sidelined her since September. "Following my injury at the US Open and an extensive rehabilitation phase, it turned out that a medical intervention was necessary. So here I am, tired and sad, but I know I'll be okay now," Muchova wrote on social media. "The surgery was successful and I'm gonna do all I can to see you on the court soon." Muchova is currently ranked 10th. She reached her first Grand Slam final at Roland Garros in 2023.
