Indian Wells Day 6 Previews: Sebastian Korda vs. Daniil Medvedev. Medvedev is coasting under the radar at the moment, but his game—at its best—looks Slam-worthy. To his benefit, the outward pressure isn’t on him to perform, which means he can focus more on remaining grounded and grinding through tournaments like he knows and loves to do. Is he capable of defeating Medvedev? He leads the head-to-head record 2-1, winning the latest two meetings last season, so he has the confidence. But this is a big spot, and Medvedev is due for a title run himself. Winner: Daniil Medvedev.
