Alexander Zverev made no mistake with his second chance to close out a win over No. 2-ranked Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday night and moved into an Australian Open semifinal against two-time finalist Daniil Medvedev. Alexander Zverev was up a break in the third set and missed a chance to serve out the win, but he didn't blink the second time, finishing off a 6-1, 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-4 victory. Wimbledon champion Alcaraz was the only player to beat 10-time Australian Open winner Novak Djokovic in a Grand Slam match last year. He won't get the chance in Australia this time.
