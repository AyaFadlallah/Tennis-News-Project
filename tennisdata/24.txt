Spain has been plunged into the ‘Group of Death’ after the draw for the Davis Cup Finals Group stage, meaning coach David Ferrer may need his big-hitters to step forward for the ties in September. After missing out on a place in the finals in Malaga last year, Spain need to come through a group featuring a powerful Australia team, as well as a strong Czech Republic side and a potent France line-up to avoid missing out for a second-year in a row. Alex de Minaur will lead the Australian charge in a group that will feature a Czech team.
