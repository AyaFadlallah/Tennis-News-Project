When the first serve is delivered Monday at the 2024 Mexican Open in Acapulco, it will come exactly four months and a day after it seemed certain the tennis tournament would not come to pass. In a 12-hour-period beginning on the evening of Oct. 24, Hurricane Otis strengthened from a tropical storm to a Category 5, sustaining winds of over 165 mph as it made landfall in the Mexican state of Guerrero on the country's Pacific coastline. Otis collided head on with Acapulco, causing dozens of deaths and billions in destruction while creating an ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region.
