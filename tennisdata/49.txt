The WTA has begun a review of its rules that could see players cleared of doping offenses or have their bans reduced return to the circuit with "special rankings" in the future. The rule change is being considered following the high-profile case of Halep, who made her comeback at the Miami Open with a wild card after the Romanian's four-year doping ban was cut to nine months. Unlike in the case of serious injuries or maternity leave, players banned for doping offenses are currently not afforded protected rankings on their return and often have to rebuild their careers from scratch.
