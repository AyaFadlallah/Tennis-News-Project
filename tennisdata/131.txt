The ATP and WTA say they are looking into forming a combined "commercial entity," but otherwise are staying mum publicly about what potentially is a significant moment. The ATP recently struck a deal with the PIF that includes naming rights for the men's rankings; that followed the placement of a year-end tournament for young players in Saudi Arabia. There already is a provision to allow the ATP to add a 10th Masters tournament, and Saudi Arabia could get that spot on the calendar. The WTA is expected to close a deal to put its annual season-ending championship in Saudi Arabia.
