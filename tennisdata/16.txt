Tennis legend Martina Navratilova has declared that even Novak Djokovic feels doubt “no matter what” after the great Serbian’s titleless start to the 2024 season. Navratilova doesn’t think Djokovic will be worried about his form given his mindset, while assessing that “the bad days are worse” as players get older. The world No 1 saw his 33-match winning streak at the Australian Open end with a four-set defeat to eventual champion Sinner at the 2024 edition of the major in January. The 36-year-old has won the Melbourne Grand Slam a record 11 times and has not tasted defeat since 2018.
