Former Wimbledon and French Open champion Simona Halep was confident she would soon return to tennis after exiting sport's top court Friday following three days of proceedings to appeal a doping suspension that could end her career. "I had the chance to show my defense, and I really believe that the truth is going to come out and the day to be on court is going to be soon," Halep told reporters outside the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne. The 32-year-old Romanian player has been provisionally suspended since October 2022 after testing positive for roxadustat, a banned drug.
