What happens when two tennis players get married in the off-season? They double up on their honeymoon by tacking on a training bloc in Dubai. “It wasn’t exactly a vacation!” joked Anastasia Potapova, who married ATP pro-Alexander Shevchenko in December. “We were practicing every day. But it was nice.” Potapova, 22, and Shevchenko, 23, planned to be married by the end of 2023 after making their relationship public this year. That didn’t make his proposal at a hotel in September any less surprising for the No.33, who is in the midst of a career-best run at the BNP Paribas Open.
