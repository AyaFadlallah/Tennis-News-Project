The BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells brought out familiar faces Sunday. Zendaya and her boyfriend, Tom Holland, were on hand in the California desert for the women's championship match between Iga Swiatek and Maria Sakkari. The actress stars as fictional professional tennis player Tashi Duncan in the upcoming film "Challengers" by Director Luca Guadagnino.   Maria Swiatek won 6-4, 6-0, and posed for photos with Zendaya afterward. Sporting events are a recurrent date activity for Zendaya and her boyfriend Holland. Last year, Zendaya and Holland were courtside for a playoff matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors.
