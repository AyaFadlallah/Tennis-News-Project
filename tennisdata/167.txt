Beginning with his Las Vegas exhibition match against Rafa Nadal, "Alcaraz, the docuseries" will follow the 20-year-old both on and off the court during his 2024 season. The project is only the latest sports story to head to Netflix. Itâ€™s also the first tennis project announced since the news broke that *Break Point* would not be renewed for a third season. Created by the team behind DTS, Alcaraz, the docuseries was initially met with enthusiasm from players and fans but eventually fizzled out, with insiders citing poor viewership numbers, lack of engaging personalities and insufficient access to the top players.
