Facing off in the California desert for the first time in over a decade, Caroline Wozniacki and Angelique Kerber turned back the clock for a vintage fourth-round contest at the BNP Paribas Open, with Caroline Wozniacki ultimately prevailing, 6-4, 6-2. "Things were going a bit my way," Caroline Wozniacki said on the court directly after the match. "I could see she was struggling a bit with her back, but even if it's a slower lefty serve, it's still a lefty serve and quite tricky. So, I just tried to stay focused out there and I'm just very happy I won."
