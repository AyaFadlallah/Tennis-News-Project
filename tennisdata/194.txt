
On Thursday night, Viktoriya Tomova and Sofia Kenin will clash in the opening round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. On paper, this probably looks like a match that should go the 2020 Australian Open championâ€™s way. And the betting public thinks so, as roughly 70% of the bets for this match have come in on Kenin. However, Kenin has really struggled in 2024, leaving the door open for Tomova to pull off the upset. And I like the Bulgarian to get the job done. Kenin is on a five-match losing streak, and is just 1-6 in 2024.
