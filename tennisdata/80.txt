Miami Open tournament director and former top 10 player James Blake was fined $56,250 for violating tennis' rules about betting sponsorship, the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced. ITIA said the violation was unintentional and Blake "cooperated fully with the investigation and didn’t contest the charge.” If Blake breaks the rules again during an 18-month probationary period, the agency said he would be subject to an 18-month suspension and an additional fine. The sport bars people from having commercial relationships with gambling companies. U.S. Davis Cup team coaches were fined once $10,000 apiece for promoting a gambling operator via social media.
