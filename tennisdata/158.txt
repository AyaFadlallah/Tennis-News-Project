Iga Swiatek is one win away from becoming queen of the desert for a second time in three years: the world No. 1 dispatched Marta Kostyuk, 6-2, 6-1 to reach the 2024 BNP Paribas Open final. "I'm proud of myself and really excited," Swiatek said after the match. "I think it was a great match for me today. I have positive vibes." Competing in chilly, overcast conditions, Swiatek was red hot against an out-of-sorts Kostyuk, striking just six unforced errors in two sets to reach her 10th WTA 1000 final in one hour and nine minutes on Stadium 1 Court.
