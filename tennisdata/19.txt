Novak Djokovic continued his record-breaking streak at No 1 in the ATP Rankings on Monday, but Carlos Alcaraz was the big winner at the Indian Wells Open after holding off Jannik Sinner for the No 2 ranking. Despite his shock third-round exit from the ATP Masters 1000 event, Novak Djokovic was always assured of remaining at No 1 in the rankings and he has now spent an incredible 417 weeks at the top. The good news for the 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic is that he is mathematically assured of staying No 1 for at least another three weeks.
