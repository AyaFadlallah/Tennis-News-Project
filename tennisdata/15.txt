Toni Nadal has likened the iconic tennis rivalry shared by his nephew Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer, to the dynamic between football legends Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.  The renowned coach claimed Nadal is comparable to Ronaldo, while Federer is like Messi, but feels there are “more differences” between the football icons than the tennis greats. Federer and Nadal, who faced off 40 times over 15 years from 2004 to 2019, formed one of tennis’ greatest ever rivalries. Nadal holds a 24-16 advantage, having previously held 23-10 and 6-1 leads, while Federer won six of the pair’s last seven encounters.
