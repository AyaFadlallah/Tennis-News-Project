The longest match in tennis history lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes, with the players competing over three days. Let's look back at that showdown and examine other marathon matches. At Wimbledon in 2010, the first-round match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes. The two battled over three days. Their match featured five sets, including a 138-point fifth set. (Wimbledon did not use a tiebreak in the fifth set at the time.) On Day 3, Isner won the deciding final set, 70-68. There were 980 total points, including 711 points in the fifth set.
