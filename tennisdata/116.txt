Iga Swiatek has never sparked the sort of hype lavished on some of her peers and rivals. That may have something with being from Poland, a nation that lacks the tennis cache of, say, the Czech Republic. Or it may be because Swiatek’s game is so well integrated. Or perhaps it owes to her bearing, which isn’t intimidating. Maybe it’d be different if she didn’t seem so cerebral, so indifferent to transactional operations with the media. Yet she’s on the cusp of becoming one of the towering Grand Slam champions of the present era while flying well under the radar.
