Emma Raducanu was in an upbeat mood as she prepared to play her first match at the Miami Open after some encouraging displays in Indian Wells, but all that optimism has come crashing down. Raducanu was due to play in Miami after he was handed a wildcard by tournament organisers, with the 2021 US Open champion expressing her excitement to return to Miami as she looks to climb back up the WTA rankings after missing most of last year due to injury.
She was due to take on No 52 Wang Xiyu, with Anna Kalinskaya a potential second round opponent.
