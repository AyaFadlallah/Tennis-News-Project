It marked the No. 3 seed's second win over the Czech in a matter of weeks, having also prevailed against Siniakova in the second-round in Dubai. "She's obviously a great player, always puts up a great fight," said Navarro, "She's super talented and made it tough on me a couple of weeks ago in Dubai and again here tonight. I struggled a little bit from time to time, but I'm happy with the win."
