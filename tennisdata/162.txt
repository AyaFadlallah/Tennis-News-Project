This week, Zabiiako took to social media to share a teaser video to promote their newest guest. The figure skating champion told viewers to “guess by voice” the player’s identity—and internet detectives were quick to solve the mystery. “I begged her! I begged her to come on her YouTube channel,” a voice that sounded suspiciously like one Gauff gushes off-screen. “Yesterday I was like, can I please be on your YouTube channel? Every player has been on there!” “Coco” will indeed join guests like Elena Rybakina, Jessica Pegula and Aryna Sabalenka who have made appearances on What The Vlog.
