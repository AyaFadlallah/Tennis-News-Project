With the women’s final, we can’t ignore that Sakkari hasn’t taken a set from Swiatek since 2021. I know Sakkari has played some much better tennis this week than she has all year, and the Greek finally has some confidence back. But it’s hard to see where she has a clear edge over Swiatek. The Pole is a better server, returner and baseline player, and she’s also in tremendous form right now. I sometimes worry about Swiatek against big servers and powerful baseline players, but Sakkari is similar to her. The Pole is just better and a title more battle-tested.
