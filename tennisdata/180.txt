In her return to the BNP Paribas Open, Caroline Wozniacki has looked vintage in most ways but one. While she was once the featured face of Adidas' Stella McCartney-designed tennis division, the former world No. 1 has found herself wearing the same match kits as her opposition on the court in Tennis Paradise. Take, for one, her third-round match against American Katie Volynets. The 22-year-old, 11 years Wozniacki's junior, looked like she could play a stunt double for the 2018 Australian Open champion as she scampered around Stadium 1, showing off down-the-line backhands that rivaled the Dane at her best.
