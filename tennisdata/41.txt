Saville continues to charge back toward the top 100 after experiencing a series of injury setbacks. The 29-year-old upset 58th-ranked Zhu Lin for the second time in 2024, 6-3, 6-3. She also defeated the Chinese baseliner in January on her way to the semifinals in Hobart, Australia. "I definitely had to run a lot today," said Saville, who converted all four of her break-point opportunities against Zhu. "But that's basically my game. I'm glad that I took opportunities when I could, took my own chances and made it happen." It was the third win in as many days for Saville.
