
Carlos Alcaraz is going to have his work cut out for him against Daniil Medvedev. Alcaraz beat the Russian when they met at the ATP Finals in November, but Daniil Medvedev beat up on the Spaniard at the US Open. And Medvedev will be looking for revenge from last year’s Indian Wells final, where Carlos Alcaraz bullied him off the court. But Alcaraz just looks like he’s on another level at the moment. The Spaniard earned a straight-set win over Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals, and he also dealt Jannik Sinner his first loss of the season in the semis.
