 Aryna Sabalenka addressed the death of her former partner Konstantin Koltsov with a statement posted to her Instagram story and released by her agent. "Konstantin's death is an unthinkable tragedy, and while we were no longer together, my heart is broken," Sabalenka wrote. "Please respect my privacy and his family's privacy during this difficult time." They began dating in 2021 and had not publicly revealed they had broken up. Koltsov, 42, had three children from a previous relationship. Sabalenka remained in the Miami Open draw following the news of Koltsov's death and practiced at the tournament Tuesday, wearing all black.
