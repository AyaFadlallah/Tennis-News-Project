Carlos Alcaraz retired hurt from the Rio Open on Tuesday after two games due to a right ankle injury. The retirement at 1-1 meant Brazil's Thiago Monteiro advanced to the second round. He will face his compatriot Felipe Meligeni Alves for a place in the quarterfinals. Alcaraz twisted his ankle in the first game after only two points. He received medical attention, and broke Monteiro's serve, but after the Brazilian pulled level he shook his rival's hand and left the court walking as his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero looked concerned. He said his doctors said the injury was not serious.
