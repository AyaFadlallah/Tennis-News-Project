Sunday, we’ll get a pair of championship matchups at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. The day starts with Maria Sakkari taking on Iga Swiatek, and it’ll end with Daniil Medvedev facing Carlos Alcaraz. Both of these matchups happen to be rematches of previous Indian Wells finals, as Swiatek downed Sakkari in the desert in 2022, and Alcaraz beat Medvedev last year. And while both of the players that lost those past matchups will want some revenge, the best way to bet both of these matches is by pairing them together and putting the favorites in a moneyline parlay.
