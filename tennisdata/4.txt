Tennis great Todd Woodbridge has assessed that Carlos Alcaraz does not yet possess the ability held by his rival Novak Djokovic to “dictate every term on the court.” Woodbridge asserted that it is impossible to have a game as “fundamentally complete” as Alcaraz’s and “keep that together at 20”. Alcaraz defeated world No 4 Daniil Medvedev 7-6(5), 6-1 in the final of the 2024 Indian Wells Open on Sunday to defend his title at the ATP Masters 1000. The world No 2 is just the second player after Nadal to win five or more Masters 1000 titles before turning 21.
