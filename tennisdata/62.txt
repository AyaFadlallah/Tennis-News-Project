"Indian tennis needed this," Rohan Bopanna said after confirming that he'd be men's doubles world No. 1 (for the first time, at 43) when the new rankings are released on Monday. "Watching sports, you always have idols while growing up, I hope me reaching the No. 1 position inspires someone back home... I am, extremely proud that I was able to achieve this." Bopanna becoming the men's doubles world No. 1 is nothing short of inspirational. He reached his career-best ranking after a quarterfinal win at the 2024 Australian Open, becoming the oldest first-time world No. 1 in tennis history.
