And with the recent news that Netflix’s Break Point will not be renewed for a third season, Kasatkina and Zabiiako’s channel continues to provide tennis fans with probably the only true behind-the-scenes look at life as a top professional tennis player—at least until Carlos Alcaraz’s newly announced docuseries drops on the platform in 2025. The couple have racked up 42K subscribers and counting, with about 60 vlogs posted to date on a semi-weekly publishing schedule. Kasatkina and Zabiiako do all their own editing and even add subtitles in both Russian and English so international viewers don’t miss a thing.
