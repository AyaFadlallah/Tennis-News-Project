 Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz are each halfway to achieving the 2024 Sunshine Double. On Sunday, in front of a star-studded crowd that included Zendaya, Tom Holland and Charlize Theron, Swiatek defeated Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-0 in just 68 minutes to claim her second Indian Wells title. Shortly after, Alcaraz successfully defended his Indian Wells crown with a comeback victory over Daniil Medvedev 7-6 (5), 6-1, for his first title since winning Wimbledon in July. It was an impressive showing in the California desert for both players, who continue to be two of the brightest young superstars in the sport.
