Tennis legends Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova on Wednesday publicly showed their opposition amid growing speculation that the 2024 WTA Finals will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. They wrote a joint opinion piece for the Washington Post, saying the idea would be "entirely incompatible with the spirit and purpose of women's tennis and the WTA itself." Evert and Navratilova, both former world No. 1s and 18-time major singles champions who were fierce rivals during their playing days, emphasized Saudi Arabia's record of human rights violations, specifically in regard to the treatment of women and members of the LGBTQ community.
