On Friday, March 22, Andy Murray will look to snap a two-match losing streak against Tomas Martin Etcheverry when the two clash in the Round of 64 at the Miami Open. Murray is coming off a big win over Matteo Berrettini, who is starting to find his form again. The Scot has to feel like this is his best shot at going three rounds deep in a tournament for the first time since Augustâ€”and it only helps that Etcheverry will be playing his first hard-court match since February (and first match in over a month, in a general case).
