Aryna Sabalenka will open Friday's play at the Miami Open against Spain's Paula Badosa - just days after the death of her former boyfriend Konstantin Koltsov at the age of 42. Sabalenka said her "heart is broken" following the death of her former boyfriend Koltsov. Sabalenka, who is scheduled to participate in this week's Miami Open, clarified in an Instagram story on Wednesday that she and Koltsov were no longer a couple before his death. Sabalenka was pictured practising in Miami ahead of her first outing against best friend Paula Badosa, who admitted facing the Belarusian Sabalenka will be "uncomfortable".
