Defending champion Cameron Norrie was knocked out of the Rio Open with a straight-sets loss to qualifier Mariano Navone on Saturday. The Argentine, 22, beat the second-seeded British player 6-4, 6-2 to advance to his first tour-level final where he will play compatriot Sebasti치n B치ez. Norrie didn't offer much resistance to Navone despite having become the favorite to win the clay-court tournament again after Carlos Alcaraz, Stan Wawrinka and Nicol치s Jarry were all beaten or retired injured. In the earlier semifinal, fifth-seeded B치ez topped his Argentine compatriot Francisco Cerundolo 7-5, 6-0 to advance to his fifth and biggest tour-level final.
