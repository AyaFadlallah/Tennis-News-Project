Daylight savings time saw the clocks move forward an hour Sunday in the U.S. At Indian Wells, it was quite the sun-day of added light with the weather gods delivering another gorgeous sky packing plenty of heat. For Casper Ruud, the conditions inspired the Norwegian to work on his tan for the bulk of practice with hitting partner Joachim Bjerke. Ruud began his BNP Paribas Open campaign Saturday night with a straight-set win over Lukas Klein and returns to Stadium 3 Monday to face Arthur Fils. The former world No. 2 is coming off successive runner-up finishes in Los Cabos.
