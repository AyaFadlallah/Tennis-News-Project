Indian Wells proved to be an impressive tournament for many of the sport's recently returned big names. Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki, who came back in August after more than three years away and after giving birth to two children, had the best result of her comeback by reaching the quarterfinals. She had to retire from her match against Swiatek 6-4, 1-0 due to injury, but it remained a successful event and her ranking rose from No. 204 to No. 129. Fellow new mom Naomi Osaka, the four-time major winner who came back in January, reached the third round.
