There’s “life in the old dog yet! :)” These were the words of wisdom Andy Murray delivered when signing the on-court camera lens following his opening-round victory Wednesday at the Miami Open. A two-time champion at the ATP Masters 1000 event, the 36-year-old battled back to defeat Matteo Berrettini, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, in two hours and 48 minutes. “It was obviously a great win for me. “Started off a little bit slow but then I did think I played pretty well across then end of the first set through to the end of the match,” Andy Murray told ATP Media.
