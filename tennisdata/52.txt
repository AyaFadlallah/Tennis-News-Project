 Sebastian Baez won his fifth and biggest title Sunday with a 6-2, 6-1 victory against his Argentine compatriot Mariano Navone at the Rio Open. The fifth-seeded Baez wasn't seriously challenged by the 22-year-old Navone, a qualifier, in the final of the clay-court tournament. Neither of the two Argentinians had been among the favorites to lift the title, but defending champion Cameron Norrie, Carlos Alcaraz, Stan Wawrinka and Nicol√°s Jarry had all stumbled. Baez is the second Argentinian to lift the trophy, with Diego Schwartzman the first in 2018. Mariano Navone will become a top 100 player for the first time.
