Iga Swiatek and Kostyuk were facing off for the second time on the Hologic WTA tour, but the two go back to their junior days: Swiatek was the last woman to defeat Kostyuk before the latter went on to win the 2017 Australian Open girl’s singles title. Swiatek would win her first junior Slam 18 months later at Wimbledon; by the end of 2020, she was on top of the women’s game with a first Grand Slam victory at Roland Garros. Kostyuk made quicker in-roads on the WTA circuit when she reached the third round of the 2018 Australian Open.
