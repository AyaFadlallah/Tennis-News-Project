Carlos Alcaraz, the 20 years old tennis player from Spain with an ATP rank No. 2, abandoned his match against Thiago Monteiro of Brazil due to an ankle injury; three-time major winner Stan Wawrinka lost to Argentina's Facundo Díaz Acosta in straight sets; and Chile's Nicolás Jarry was knocked out by Germany's Yannick Hanfmann in three sets. Fourth-seeded Francisco Cerúndolo of Argentina advanced to the quarterfinals by beating Spain's Albert Ramos-Viñolas 6-2, 6-1. Rain later postponed to Thursday the match between second-seeded and defending champion Cameron Norrie against Tomás Barrios Vera of Chile for a place among the last eight.
