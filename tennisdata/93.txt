 Cameron Norrie started his defense of the Rio Open title by beating Bolivia's Hugo Dellien 6-3, 6-2 on Monday. "This is a special place for me, I won my biggest title last year here," Norrie said. "I have another chance to work on my game and maybe enjoy the beach a little." Norrie upset Carlos Alcaraz in the 2023 final and both are seeded to make the final again. The second-seeded Norrie will face Chile's Tomas Barrios Vera next. Also, fourth-seeded player Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina won. Alcaraz will play his opener on Tuesday against home crowd hope Thiago Monteiro.
