The 2021 NCAA singles champion won her first WTA title in Hobart to open the season, reached the third round at a major for the first time at the Australian Open, then advanced to her first 1000 level quarterfinals at Indian Wells behind upset victories over Elina Svitolina and Aryna Sabalenka. Emma Navarro lost to Maria Sakkari in three sets but is now ranked at a new career high of No. 2 and is the fourth ranked American woman -- and her Indian Wells run made quite the impression.
