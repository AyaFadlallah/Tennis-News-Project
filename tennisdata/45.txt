
There was lots of attention on Djokovic entering Indian Wells. He was playing there for the first time in five years, and in his first tournament since losing to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open semifinals. While Djokovic seemed to have some fun while on-site, and at multiple Los Angeles Lakers games, we can say the trip didn't live up to his, or anyone's, expectations. The 24-time major champion lost in the third round 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 to Luca Nardi. Nardi ranked No. 123 in the world, became the lowest-ranked player to ever beat Djokovic at a Masters 1000-level event.
