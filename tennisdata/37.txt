 Novak Djokovic on Tuesday said he was excited to return to Indian Wells to compete at the BNP Paribas Open for the first time since 2019 after U.S. travel restrictions related to COVID-19 had kept him away. The world's top-ranked player is seeking an unprecedented sixth title at the Masters 1000 event that begins next week and is regarded as the largest tennis tournament outside of the four Grand Slams. "It has been five years, way too long to not be part of the Tennis Paradise tournament, one of the best tournaments in the world without a doubt," Djokovic said.
