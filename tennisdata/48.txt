Countless tennis players live and train in Florida, but perhaps no one will get a bigger reception from the crowd at the Miami Open than Delray Beach native Coco Gauff. She reached the semifinals at Indian Wells for the first time last week -- and celebrated her 20th birthday at the tournament â€“ and will be looking to win her second title in 2024. Gauff, the world No. 3, will play either Ashlyn Krueger or a qualifier in her opening match. Gauff and Pegula are the defending doubles champions and will try to repeat their first title together of the season.
