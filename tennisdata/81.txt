Ivo Karlovic, the towering Croatian known for his booming serve, has announced his retirement from tennis more than two years after playing his last tournament match. The 6-foot, 11-inch Karlovic said in a post Wednesday on X, that "I've had a very gratifying, unorthodox, and long career coming from extremely humble beginnings, especially for a tennis player." Karlovic, who will turn 45 next week, played his last ATP match in a second-round qualifying loss at Indian Wells, California, in October 2021. His last Grand Slam tournament match was a first-round singles loss at the US Open about six weeks earlier.
