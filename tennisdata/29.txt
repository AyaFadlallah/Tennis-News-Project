Alex De Minaur beat Sebastian Ofner 6-1, 6-3 on Wednesday to reach the quarterfinals at the Mexican Open. De Minaur will face Stefanos Tsitsipas, who advanced to the quarters of the ATP 500 event with a 6-3, 7-6 (6) win over  Cobolli. De Minaur, a 25-year-old Australian, has 10 ATP Tour titles and Tsitsipas has seven. But the Greek player has never won a 500-level event despite two wins in Masters 1000 tournaments. Tsitsipas is 0-10 in 500 finals, including Acapulco in 2021. De Minaur became the first defending champion in Mexico to reach the quarterfinals since Thiem in 2017.
