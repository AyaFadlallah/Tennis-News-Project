Nick Kyrgios has offered up conflicting comments on his attempts to return to tennis and it seems we may be edging closer to getting some clarity over his plans. He played in just one tournament last year as his career was derailed by injuries. He has made several attempts to come back to competitive action but failed to get back on the court as his career appeared to be heading in an alternative direction. The Australian has taken time off from the professional circuit due to injury, with his success as a TV commentator at the Australian Open fuelling speculation.
