Iga Swiatek might be best known for her prowess on the clay and at Roland Garros, but it's Doha, the capital of Qatar, where she has become virtually unbeatable. The world No. 1 has now claimed the title in the Qatar capital for three consecutive years. With her 7-6 (8), 6-2 victory over Elena Rybakina on Saturday in the final, she became the first player to win the Doha title more than twice and the first woman to win a singles title at an event in three straight years since Serena Williams did so in Miami from 2013 to 2015.
