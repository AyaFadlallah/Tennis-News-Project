That’s a day Swiatek will want to remember on Sunday, and Sakkari will want to forget—at least not obsess over. Swiatek won the title going away, 6-4, 6-1, and didn’t lose another match until Wimbledon. At that point, these two women seemed to both be in contention for the No. 1 ranking. Two years later, we know who won that race. Their careers have gone in opposite directions since. Iga has won three major titles and held the top ranking for the past 24 months. Maria lost in the first round at three of the four Slams last year.
