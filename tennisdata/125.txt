Anhelina Kalinina was down and almost out with former top-ranked player Caroline Wozniacki one point away from winning in straight sets at the Miami Open. But she saved that match point and won the last five games of the second set before taking the third in a 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 victory in the second round. Wozniacki, who won the Australian Open in 2018 and retired from tennis at the same tournament two years later, returned to the sport last year. She had two children during her time away from the game. Wozniacki reached the quarterfinals in Indian Wells this month.
