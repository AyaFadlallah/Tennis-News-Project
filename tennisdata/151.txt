Coco Gauff shared an unforgettable trip to In-N-Out and subsequent encounter with a family of Coco superfans after a disappointing exit from the BNP Paribas Open on her social media on Saturday. Gauff endured a 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-2 defeat to 2022 finalist Maria Sakkari, snapping a 20-match winning streak on U.S. that saw her win titles in Washington, D.C., Cincinnati, and the US Open. All that winning, Gauff revealed on Daria Kasatkina’s *What The Vlog?* YouTube series, meant she had never found time to try the famous west-coast burger chain. “Solid 8/10 burger was good!” was Gauff’s official review.
