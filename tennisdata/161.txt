Growing up in Los Angeles, Hanna Dessie found her love for tennis at a young age thanks to her mother.. Born as "an ordinary kid ... not born into wealth," her mother says, Dessie overcame adversity and been able to live her dreams on and off the court as a result of the vision of actor Boris Kodjoe, his wife Nicole Ari Parker, and the Love All scholarship program sponsored by their family's charitable foundation, the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy and Tennis Channel. Kodjoe and Ari Parker have led their foundation since 2008, when it was called the Sophie's Voice Foundation.
