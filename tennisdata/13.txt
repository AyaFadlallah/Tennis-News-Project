Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Daniil Medvedev have learned their paths for the 2024 Miami Open, while Andy Murray has been handed an intriguing opening round draw. With world No 1 Novak Djokovic opting to skip the ATP Masters 1000 tournament, Alcaraz is the top seed, while Sinner and Medvedev are seeded second and third respectively. Alcaraz retained his title at the Indian Wells Open last week, where he defeated Medvedev in the final after a semi-final victory over Sinner. Andy Murray will face 2021 Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini. This will likely be Britâ€™s final appearance at the Miami Open.
