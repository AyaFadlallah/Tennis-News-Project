“I can’t lie to myself,” Rafael Nadal said of his decision to withdraw from Indian Wells on Wednesday. He had arrived early to try to be ready and even played an exhibition with Carlos Alcaraz over the weekend. But he couldn’t overcome his latest hip injury in time to compete for real. So far, Rafa’s farewell tour of 2024 is coming up short on farewells. After playing three matches in Brisbane, and tearing a hip muscle in the process, he had to withdraw from the Australian Open, where he was a two-time champion. Now he has withdrawn from Indian Wells.
