Defending champion and top-seeded Carlos Alcaraz from Spain advanced to the quarterfinals of the Argentina Open by beating Camilo Carabelli 6-2, 7-5 on Thursday in his first clay-court match of the season. The 20-year-old Spanish Carlos Alcaraz came from 2-0 down in the second set against his Argentine opponent. "I started really nervous, I'm not going to lie, with the crowd behind him, supporting him," Alcaraz said. "I think it's normal, obviously, but really happy with my first match on clay since (the French Open)." He will next play Italy's Andrea Vavassori, who beat Laslo Djere of Serbia 6-4, 7-5.
