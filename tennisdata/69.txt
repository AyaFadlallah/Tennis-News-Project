Cameron Norrie beat Tomás Barrios Vera 6-1, 6-1 to reach the quarterfinals of the Rio Open Thursday. Norrie needed just 26 minutes to take the first set of a match originally scheduled for a day earlier but postponed. The British player will face home favorite Thiago Seyboth Wild on Friday. Seyboth Wild advanced by beating Jaume Munar 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 to become the first Brazilian to reach the tournament's quarterfinals since 2017. No. 23 Norrie became the favorite to win the clay-court tournament once again after Carlos Alcaraz, Stan Wawrinka, and Nicolás Jarry were all earlier beaten or retired injured.
