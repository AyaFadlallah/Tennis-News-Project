Andy Murray will make an appearance in Germany before he retires from tennis as it has been announced he will feature at the 2024 edition of the BMW Open in Munich.  He has not played in the Bavarian International Tennis Championships since winning the title at the ATP 250 clay-court event in 2015. The 2024 installment of the tournament will run in the third week of the clay-court season, which will get underway at the start of next month. Murrayâ€™s decision to compete in Munich suggests he will likely feature more prominently on clay than he has in recent years.
