
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the professional tennis tour for men have agreed to a five year partnership that includes naming rights for the ATP rankings, the latest move by the kingdom into that sport and others. The ATP already had a deal that placed its Next Gen ATP Finals -- a tournament for players 21 and under -- in Jeddah from 2023 through 2027. The arrangement announced Wednesday includes courtside branding for the PIF at the season ending ATP Finals and tournaments in Indian Wells, California; Miami, Madrid and Beijing. Pepperstone has sponsored the ATP rankings since 2022.
