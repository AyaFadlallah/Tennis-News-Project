Miami Day 3 previews: Lorenzo Sonego vs. Daniel Evans. These Top 50 competitors have faced off three times, with the Italian prevailing on each occasion including a three-set win on these very courts last year. They squared off earlier this season in the first round of the Australian Open, with Sonego advancing in four sets. Coming into this match, both, the 28 years old Italian born in Turin and the 33 years old English tennis player born in Birmingham are eager to ignite a momentum shiftâ€”for the two are a combined 6-14 in 2024. The Winner was Lorenzo Sonego.
