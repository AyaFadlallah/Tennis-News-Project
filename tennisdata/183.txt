Who wears short shorts? Holger Rune does, and he’s happy to make them even shorter in a pinch. “I think five inches is pretty good,” he said of his Nike inseam at the BNP Paribas Open. “I don’t know how long these are, but they’re around five.” Rune has attracted notice for his nod to 80s tennis fashion, sporting shorts reminiscent of peak John McEnroe. Visiting the Tennis Channel Live Desk after a 6-2, 7-6 (5) win over Lorenzo Musetti, he joked that pulling them higher helped him shake off a missed overhead and secure the match in straight sets.
